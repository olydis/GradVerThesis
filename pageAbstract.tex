\end{center}
Formal verification using Hoare logic is a powerful tool to prove properties of imperative computer programs.

%Implicit dynamic frames (\cite{Smans:2012:IDF:2160910.2160911}) is a variant of separation logic that supports heap-dependent expressions inside assertions.

However, in practice programmers often face situations  ... rigid... not flexible...
- incomplete information about parts of the program
- laziness, forced to annotate everything
- unable to express due to limited syntax
- unable to prove something facing undecidability

To counteract these limitations we introduce the notion of gradual formulas with an unknown part ``?''.

The main contribution of this work is presenting a gradual verification logic that covers the full range between completely unannotated programs and fully annotated programs.
We prove the soundness of this logic and ... Siek et al. (2015).
