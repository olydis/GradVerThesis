% IDEA: separate theoretical/general approach and concrete decisions
% this means, for example, that:
% PART1:
% - requirements for lifted functions, soundness

\chapter{Introduction}
Most modern programming languages use static analysis to some degree, ruling out certain types of runtime failure.
Static analysis provides guarantees about the dynamic behavior of a program without actually running the program.
Static typing disciplines are among the most common representatives of static analysis, guaranteeing type safety at compile time, obviating the need for dynamic checks.
In reality, most programming languages combine ..., e.g. null-checks.

Another powerful technique is static verification of programs against their specification, i.e. statically proving their “correctness”.
In practice this is achieved by checking that some annotated invariants or assertions (reflecting the specification) must always hold.
% example?
Unfortunately, static verification has limitations:
\begin{itemize} % TODO
    \item Syntax
    \item Decidability
    \item Difficult and Tedious to annotate programs
    \item ...
\end{itemize}


Type systems weakened (casts, ...)



This work will also show that gradual verification ... other angle!
