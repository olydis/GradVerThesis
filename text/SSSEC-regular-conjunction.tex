%% motivation
The syntax of \svlidf does not include a regular (non-separating) conjunction operator $\phiAnd{\cdot}{\cdot}$.
It proves useful under some circumstances (e.g. to simply combine the knowledge of several formulas into one formula), but would complicate formula semantics and subsequent reasoning significantly.
In this section we will show that there is also no way of defining the operator in terms of existing syntax, i.e. as syntactic sugar.

%% def
Intuitively, we expect a conjunction to be satisfied by a program environment iff both of its operands are satisfied by the same program environment.
This intuition can be formalized as
\begin{displaymath}
\envs{\phiAnd{$\phi_1$}{$\phi_2$}} = \envs{\phi_1} \cap \envs{\phi_2}
\end{displaymath}

%% example
\begin{example}{Tricky Access}
    Consider $\phi \defeq \phiAnd{\phiAcc{a}{f}}{\phiAcc{b}{f}}$.
    According to above equation, $\phi$ is satisfied by an environment $\pi$, if it contains access to $\ttt{a.f}$ and $\ttt{b.f}$.
    Since we want to define $\phiAnd{\cdot}{\cdot}$ in terms of existing syntax, it should be possible to define $\phi$ using that syntax.
    
    Attempt:
    We can prove that
    \begin{displaymath}
    \phi_1 = \phiCons{\phiAcc{a}{f}}{\phiAcc{b}{f}}}
    \end{displaymath}
    and
    \begin{displaymath}
    \phi_2 = \phiCons{\phiEq{a}{b}}{\phiAcc{b}{f}}
    \end{displaymath}
    are formulas that would imply $\phi$ and that there exist no larger formulas (w.r.t. $\phiImplies{}{}$) with that property.
    
    Unfortunately, neither $\phi_1$ nor $\phi_2$ are implied by $\phi$, which means that $\phi \not \in \setFormula$.
\end{example}

Above examples proves by shows that $\phiAnd{\cdot}{\cdot}$ cannot be defined using existing syntax of \svlidf.
The fundamental problem is the linear nature of accessibility-predicates, which makes explicit whether certain memory locations alias or not.
Therefore, any formula giving access to fields $\ttt{a.f}$ and $\ttt{b.f}$ will always imply either $\phiEq{a}{b}$ or $\phiNeq{a}{b}$ but never be unspecific about it, as would be necessary in the example above.
