With the rules for lifting set up we can apply them to the static verification predicate:
Lifting 
$$\thoare {~} {\cdot} {\cdot} {\cdot} ~~~\subseteq~~~ \setFormula \times \setStmt \times \setFormula$$
w.r.t. all parameters yields
$$\gthoare {~} {\cdot} {\cdot} {\cdot} ~~~\subseteq~~~ \setGFormula \times \setGStmt \times \setGFormula$$

% talk about our expectation that dynamic measures are now necessary, examples, ...



% TODO: reiterate the following: some aspect missing?
% instead, make rules deterministic and inherently sound
% => they might still not be optimal (we will define measure), but at least verifier is not to blame
% => about non-optimality formalism is to blame, not some inference mechanism (conflict of interest! formulas as strong as possible, verifier as “good”/successful as possible)
% => whether “working” intermediate formula exists is generally not even decidable! (already follows from satisfiability itself not being decidable...)
