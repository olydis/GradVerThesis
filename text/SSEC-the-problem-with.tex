%% Intro
As seen in section \ref{ssec:gradual-soundness}, the lifted Hoare predicate in general requires an additional assertion to guarantee preservation.
% There is no way around this (the programmer simply \textit{is} able to specify postconditions that are not guaranteed to hold)
Yet, there is a more fundamental design issue connected to the gradual lifting approach which we will illustrate in this section.

%% Rule-wise approach
...rule-wise lifting yields overall lifting... neat.

%% problem
Problem: non-deterministic! Compiler has to find “good” intermediate formulas
\begin{description}
    \item[too weak] could always choose $\qm$
    \item[too strong] could choose stuff that is not guaranteed by runtime... (so: inject runtime assertions? yes: could be wrong! no: could enter method violating precondition)
\end{description}
% other problem: compositition and guessing
