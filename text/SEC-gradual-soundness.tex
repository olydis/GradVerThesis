Proposed gradual Hoare logic is sound w.r.t. the small-step semantics.
% BY construction, what about progress? \gsssem exceptional? THEOREM?

However, \gvlidf also complies with the stronger notion of soundness \tset{GDPreservation}.
We will show how the small-step semantics $\sssem$ and $\gsssem$ already realize the approach introduced in section \ref{ssec:atomic--knowledge}.

Specifically, we show that for some statements, $\sssem$ successfully executes the statement precisely iff Hoare logic is able to deduce information about the execution.
For all composite statements (sequence, calls and hold), we prove by induction that \tset{GDPreservation} holds for them as well.
