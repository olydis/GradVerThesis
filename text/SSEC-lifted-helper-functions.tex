%% Intro
In section \ref{sssec:examples-lift-determ} we established how inductively defined predicates can be lifted rule-wise and how composite rules can be lifted by lifting them piecewise and composing the resulting functions (lemma \ref{lemma:det-lift-comp}).

In this section we identify components the Hoare rules are made of (e.g. implications and self-framing checks) and define deterministic liftings for them.
