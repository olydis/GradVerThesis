Let $\gsstep{\cdot}{\cdot} : \setGProgramState \rightharpoonup \setGProgramState$ be a sound gradual lifting of $\sstep{\cdot}{\cdot} : \setProgramState \rightharpoonup \setProgramState$.
As shown in section \ref{ssec:gradual-soundness}, \tset{\gradT Soundness} is a tautology, i.e. the gradual system is sound.

%% soundnessX
However, in case the deterministic lifting approach is used to derive a gradual Hoare logic it is desirable to satisfy the stronger notion of soundness introduced in section \ref{ssec:the-deterministic-approach} (definition \ref{def:dgsnd}).
This stronger notion allows considering return values of the deterministic lifting as static knowledge.
As illustrated in section \ref{sssec:gradual-verification-illustrated}, such static knowledge can be used for optimizations.

% To summarize, \tset{\gradT Soundness} is sufficient for a gradual system whereas \tset{\dgradT Soundness} is valuable for optimizations.
In the remainder of this section we will thus determine sufficient criteria for \tset{\dgradT Soundness}.

Running example:
$$\dgthoare{~}{\qm}{\sAssert{\phiEq{x}{3}}}{\withqmGen{\phiEq{x}{3}}}$$
holds but not
$$\gtHoare{~}{\qm}{\sAssert{\phiEq{x}{3}}}{\withqmGen{\phiEq{x}{3}}}$$

So far, our definition of $\gsssem$ as a total lifting of $\sssem$ may be to weak, breaking the subset relationship:
\begin{description}
    \item[$\sssem$ too weak]
    It is possible that the dynamic semantics of \svl defines
    $$\sssem^{\sAssert{\phiEq{x}{3}}}(\pi_{\phiEq{x}{4}}) = \pi'_{\phiEq{x}{4}}$$
    This is not unreasonable, since this function is guaranteed to be only called with “valid” program states in the static system!
    An additional runtime check would be overhead.
    
    \item[$\gsssem$ too weak]
    If $\sssem^{\sAssert{\phiEq{x}{3}}}(\pi_{\phiEq{x}{4}})$ is undefined due to runtime checks.
    Yet, the lifting is supposed to be total, so passing along the program state unchecked is again a valid realization:
    $$\gsssem^{\sAssert{\phiEq{x}{3}}}(\pi_{\phiEq{x}{4}}) = \pi'_{\phiEq{x}{4}}$$
    Mapping to an exception would have been better in this case.
\end{description}
Note that both problems are unrelated to optimality of the lifting.

%% first: changes in source code!!!
% making formula gradual 
% - cannot let execution fail 
% - cannot satisfy less formulas (“observational compatibility”})
