We use Hoare logic \cite{hoare1969axiomatic} as the formal logic used for static verification.
We assume that source code annotations can be translated into Hoare logic.

\begin{example}{Hoare Logic for Contract Verification}~\\
    Consider a programming language with built-in syntax for method contracts.
    \begin{lstlisting}
int getArea(int w, int h)
    requires 0 <= w && 0 <= h;
    ensures  result == w * h;
{
    return w * h;
}
    \end{lstlisting}
    This method contract can be translated into a Hoare triple.
    \begin{displaymath}
    \hoare{\ttt{0 <= w \&\& 0 <= h}}{\sReturn{w * h;}}{\ttt{result == w * h}}
    \end{displaymath}
    The validity of this triple can then be verified using a sound Hoare logic.
\end{example}
