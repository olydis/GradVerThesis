The previous sections describe how lifting is performed in order to deal with $\setGFormula$ instead of $\setFormula$.
In general, the same rules apply to any gradual extension of an existing set that comes with a concretization function, e.g. $\setGStmt$ or $\setGProgramState$.

For instance, the signature of Hoare rules contains $\setStmt$ and can therefore be lifted w.r.t. this parameter using the definitions in section \ref{sec:gradual-statements}.
