metric of progress of the verification process
and allows the verification engineer to focus on the remaining statements.
Gradual verification is not a new static verification technique. It is an extension
that can be applied to any existing static verification techniques to provide
additional information to the verification engineer. Thus, issues, such as handling
of loops or aliasing are not addressed in this paper. These are problems
related to sound verification, but gradual verification is about how to make the
use of such verification more traceable and quantifiable

Software development and maintenance are costly endeavors.
The cost can be reduced if more software defects are
detected earlier in the development cycle. This paper introduces
the Extended Static Checker for Java (ESC/Java),
an experimental compile-time program checker that finds
common programming errors. The checker is powered by
verification-condition generation and automatic theorem proving
techniques. It provides programmers with a simple
annotation language with which programmer design decisions
can be expressed formally. ESC/Java examines the
annotated software and warns of inconsistencies between the
design decisions recorded in the annotations and the actual
code, and also warns of potential runtime errors in the code.
This paper gives an overview of the checker architecture and
annotation language and describes our experience applying
the checker to tens of thousands of lines of Java programs.

= static verification plus directed dynamic verification
In this paper, we present a technique to complement partial
verification results by automatic test case generation. In
contrast to existing work, our technique supports the common
case that the verification results are based on unsound
assumptions. We annotate programs to reflect which executions
have been verified, and under which assumptions.
These annotations are then used to guide dynamic symbolic
execution toward unverified program executions. Our main
technical contribution is a code instrumentation that causes
dynamic symbolic execution to abort tests that lead to verified
executions, to prune parts of the search space, and to
prioritize tests that cover more properties that are not fully
verified.
