with gradual typestates the same problem happened: as soon as the potential for unknown annotations was accepted, there was a “baseline cost” just to maintain the necessary infrastructure.
With simple gradual types, it’s almost nothing. With gradual effects, we’ve shown that it can boil down to very little (a thread-local variable with little overhead, see OOPSLA’15).
