In chapter \ref{ch:case-study--implicit} we instantiated the approach proposed in chapter \ref{ch:gradualization-of-a}, deriving a gradually verified language \gvlidf.
We mainly modeled \gvlidf abstractly, assuming that there exist implementations for the predicates and functions used in the process.
In section \ref{app:impl-strat} we give hints towards an implementation of some of those theoretical constructs.
We refrained from giving more detailed implementation instructions (with proofs that they behave as desired) as they would be very voluminous and have to deal with specifics completely unrelated to gradual typing per se.

However, we have implemented \gvlidf as a web page using TypeScript.\\
The implementation can be found at \url{http://olydis.github.io/GradVer/impl/HTML5/} (part of \cite{olydisGitHub}).
