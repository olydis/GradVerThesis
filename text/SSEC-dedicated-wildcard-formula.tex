As motivated previously, the most straight forward way to extend the syntax is by simply adding $\qm$ as a dedicated formula:
\begin{displaymath}
\grad{\phi} ::= \phi ~|~ \qm
\end{displaymath}
This is analogous to how some gradually typed languages are realized (e.g. \ttt{dynamic}-type in C\# 4.0 and upward).

% STATIC We define a helper method extracting the amount of static

We call this approach “total unknown” as programmers cannot express any additional static knowledge they might have in the presence of $\qm$.
This poses a limitation that can be overcome using the “bounded unknown” approach shown in the following section.

%For example, a programmer might resort to using the wildcard lacking some knowledge about variable \ex{x} (or being unable to express it), whereas he could give a static formula for \ex{y}, say \phiEq{y}{3}.
%Yet, there is no way to express this information as soon as the wildcard is used.
