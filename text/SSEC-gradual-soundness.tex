With the notion of sound gradual lifting we have the tools to gradualize the semantics of \svl, resulting in gradual semantics of \gvl.
More specifically, predicate lifting is applied to the Hoare logic of \svl, resulting in a gradual Hoare logic $\gthoare{~}{\cdot}{\cdot}{\cdot} ~\subseteq~ \setGFormula \times \setGStmt \times \setGFormula$ (see section \ref{sec:abstracting-static-semantics}).
Furthermore, function lifting is applied to the small-step semantics of \svl, resulting in gradual small-step semantics $\gsstep{\cdot}{\cdot} : \setGProgramState \rightarrow \setGProgramState$ (see section \ref{sec:abstracting-dynamic-semantics}).
These semantics will by construction be compatible with the semantics of \svl and comply with the gradual guarantee.

Note however that there is an additional requirement concerning the correct interplay between Hoare logic and small-step semantics, namely soundness.
We define gradual soundness of \gvl as follows:
\begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule* [Right=GProgress]
    {
        ???
    }
    {
        ???
    }
\end{mathpar}
\begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule* [Right=GPreservation]
    {
        \gthoare{~}{\grad{\phi_1}}{\grad{s}}{\grad{\phi_2}}
    }
    {
        \gtHoare{~}{\grad{\phi_1}}{\grad{s}}{\grad{\phi_2}}
    }
\end{mathpar}

%% valid gradual Hoare triples
\begin{definition}[Validity of Gradual Hoare Triples]~\\
    \label{def:valid-ghoare-triple}
    A Hoare triple $\hoare{\grad{\phi_{pre}}} {\grad{s}} {\grad{\phi_{post}}}$ is \textbf{valid}, written
    $\gtHoare{}{\grad{\phi_{pre}}} {\grad{s}} {\grad{\phi_{post}}}$
    iff
    \begin{flalign*}
    \forall \grad{\pi_{pre}}, \grad{\pi_{post}} \in \setGProgramState.~ \gsstepConsume{\grad{s}}{\grad{\pi_{pre}}}{\grad{\pi_{post}}} \implies (\evalgphiGen{\grad{\pi_{pre}}}{\grad{\phi_{pre}}} \implies \evalgphiGen{\grad{\pi_{post}}}{\grad{\phi_{post}}})
    \end{flalign*}
    
    This definition is analogous to definition \ref{def:valid-hoare-triple}.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}[Compositional Validity of Gradual Hoare Triples]
    \label{lem:comp-gtHoare}
    \begin{displaymath}
    \forall \grad{\phi_1}, \grad{\phi_2}, \grad{\phi_3} \in \setGFormula,\, \grad{s_1}, \grad{s_2} \in \setGStmt.~ \gtHoare{}{\grad{\phi_1}} {\grad{s_1}} {\grad{\phi_2}} ~\wedge~ \gtHoare{}{\grad{\phi_2}} {\grad{s_2}} {\grad{\phi_3}} \implies \tHoare{}{\grad{\phi_1}} {\sSeq{$\grad{s_1}$}{$\grad{s_2}$}} {\grad{\phi_3}}
    \end{displaymath}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Analogous to proof of lemma \ref{lem:comp-tHoare}.

%% ...have nothing to do with gradual lifting
Note that $\gtHoare {~} {\cdot} {\cdot} {\cdot}$ is not a sound gradual lifting of $\tHoare{~}{\cdot}{\cdot}{\cdot}$.
A gradual lifting would declare the Hoare triple $\hoare{\qm}{\sVarAssign{x}{3}}{\phiEq{y}{4}}$ valid due to the existence of a valid concretization, e.g. $\hoare{\phiEq{y}{4}}{\sVarAssign{x}{3}}{\phiEq{y}{4}}$).
However, this triple is clearly not valid as the postcondition is not guaranteed for all executions satisfying the precondition ($\qm$ is always satisfied).
Recall that gradual lifting was introduced in order to comply with the expectations a programmer would have when using a gradual verification system.
The validity predicate $\gtHoare {} {\cdot} {\cdot} {\cdot}$ on the other hand is defined semantically, is invisible to the programmer and therefore not affected by the logic behind gradual lifting.

%% clash
Unfortunately, the different concepts collide in the gradual preservation condition.
On the one hand gradual Hoare logic must comply with the gradual guarantee and thus verify $\gthoare{~}{\qm}{\sVarAssign{x}{3}}{\phiEq{y}{4}}$.
On the other hand $\gtHoare{~}{\qm}{\sVarAssign{x}{3}}{\phiEq{y}{4}}$ does not hold since the Hoare triple is invalid.
Gradual preservation is therefore unsatisfiable if formalized as above.

%% moral: we need dynamic checks
This conflict is nothing but a reminder that gradualization is not for free, but may require runtime checks in order to be sound.
With this in mind we can reiterate our approach for preservation.

We extend the set of final states $\setGProgramStateFin$ with a designated exceptional state $\pi_{EX}$, representing failure of a runtime check.
Furthermore we introduce an assertion statement $\sAssert{$\grad{\phi}$}$ (if not already available) that throws an exception, i.e. steps to $\pi_{EX}$ should the condition not hold.
\begin{example}{Gradual Small-Step Semantics for Runtime Assertion}
    \label{ex:ss-ra}
    We assume that $\setGProgramState = (\setVar \rightharpoonup \mathbb{Z}) \times \setGStmt$ as introduced in example \ref{ex:grad-ps}. %\ref{ex:ps-primitive}.
    Furthermore we assume that there exists a no-operation statement $\sSkip$.
    \begin{mathpar}
        \inferrule* [right=\gradT SsAssert~~~~]
        {
            \evalgphiGen{\langle \sigma, \sAssert{$\grad{\phi}$} \rangle}{\grad{\phi}}
        }
        {
            \gsstep{\langle \sigma, \sAssert{$\grad{\phi}$} \rangle}{\langle \sigma, \sSkip \rangle}
        }
        \inferrule* [right=\gradT SsAssertEx]
        {
            \neg~ \evalgphiGen{\langle \sigma, \sAssert{$\grad{\phi}$} \rangle}{\grad{\phi}}
        }
        {
            \gsstep{\langle \sigma, \sAssert{$\grad{\phi}$} \rangle}{\pi_{EX}}
        }
    \end{mathpar}
\end{example}

Preservation of can then be rewritten as
\begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule* [Right=GPreservation']
    {
        \gthoare{~}{\grad{\phi_1}}{\grad{s}}{\grad{\phi_2}}
    }
    {
        \gtHoare{~}{\grad{\phi_1}}{\sSeq{$\grad{s}$}{\sAssert{$\grad{\phi_2}$}}}{\grad{\phi_2}}
    }
\end{mathpar}
Intuitively, this definition states that an assertion is inserted during compilation whenever gradual Hoare logic is used to derive the premise.

Note that there is room for an optimized implementation of the injected assertions.
\begin{example}{Non-Optimal Runtime Check Insertion}~\\
    \label{ex:non-opt-rac-injection}
    Deducing 
    $$\gthoare {} {\qm} {\sVarAssign{y}{2}} {\phiAnd{\phiEq{x}{3}}{\phiEq{y}{2}}}$$
    would lead to the injection of
    $$\sAssert{\phiAnd{\phiEq{x}{3}}{\phiEq{y}{2}}}$$
    since
    $$\gtHoare {} {\qm} {\sSeq{\sVarAssign{y}{2}}{\sAssert{\phiAnd{\phiEq{x}{3}}{\phiEq{y}{2}}}}} {\phiAnd{\phiEq{x}{3}}{\phiEq{y}{2}}}$$
    holds.
    However, 
    $$\gtHoare {} {\qm} {\sSeq{\sVarAssign{y}{2}}{\sAssert{\phiEq{x}{3}}}} {\phiAnd{\phiEq{x}{3}}{\phiEq{y}{2}}}$$
    holds as well since $\phiEq{y}{2}$ definitely holds after the assignment.
\end{example}
We will address this problem later.

% address fact that checking that is expensive => would be cool to have static guaranteed knowledge to reduce checking => deterministic lifting...
