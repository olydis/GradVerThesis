%% more about our language
We now introduce a simplified Java-like statically verified language \svlidf that uses Chalice-like sub-syntax to express method contracts.

% more about simplicity
% - decidable satisfiability & implication of formulas (will later investigate how to extend... )
% - exactly one method arg, return type
% - not only decidable, but even polytime static semantics - entire area of research to extend boundaries there

% somewhere: implication (refer to general language)
