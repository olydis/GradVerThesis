In this section we will introduce a normal form for partially unknown formulas that proves useful for implementing a gradual verifier for \gvlidf.
One example is the function postulated in lemma \ref{lemma:impl-gimpl}, another example is gradual formula precision $\cdot \sqsubseteq \cdot$:
Originally it is defined as comparing (possibly infinite) concretizations for inclusion (see definition \ref{def:mpt}), using the following theorem the problem is reducible to checking an implication.

%% normal form
\begin{theorem}[Gradual Normal Form]\label{thm:gnf}~\\
    There exists a computable function $\snorm{\cdot} : \setFormula \rightarrow \setFormula$, such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\norm{\withqm{\phi}} \defeq \withqm{\snorm{\phi}}$ is equivalent to $\withqm{\phi}$ ~~~(for all $\phi \in \setFormula$)
        \item $\phi \implies \snorm{\phi}$
        \item $\snorm{\phi}$ contains no accessibility-predicates
        \item $\withqm{\phi_1} \sqsubseteq \withqm{\phi_2}  \quad\iff\quad  \snorm{\phi_1} \implies \snorm{\phi_2}$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
