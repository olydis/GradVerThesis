To allow combining wildcards with static knowledge, we might view \qm merely as an unknown conjunctive term within a formula:
\begin{displaymath}
\grad{\phi} ::= \phi ~|~ \withqmGen{\phi}
\end{displaymath}

We pose $\qm \defeq \withqmGen{\phiTrue}$

We expect $\withqmGen{\phi}$ to be a placeholder for a formula that also “contains” $\phi$.
There are two ways to express this containment, resulting in different concretizations.
\begin{description}
    \item[Syntactic]
    $\gamma(\withqmGen{\phi}) := \{~ \phi \wedge \phi' ~|~ \phi' \in \setFormula ~\}$
    \item[Semantic]
    $\gamma(\withqmGen{\phi}) := \{~ \phi' \in \setFormula ~|~ \phi' \implies \phi ~\}$
\end{description}
