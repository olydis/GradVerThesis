It is expected that gradual verification can induce runtime overhead.
Specifically, in the presence of unknown formulas runtime checks are necessary to guarantee soundness of the gradual system.

With the methodology we introduced in chapter \ref{ch:gradualization-of-a} there are two potential places that introduce runtime checks.
