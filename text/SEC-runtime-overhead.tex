%%intro
It is expected that gradual verification can induce runtime overhead.
Specifically, in the presence of unknown formulas runtime checks are necessary to guarantee soundness of the gradual system.

%%where runtime overhead can come from
With the methodology we introduced in chapter \ref{ch:gradualization-of-a} there are two potential causes for runtime checks.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    In general, the gradual Hoare judgment requires injection of runtime checks to ensure the postcondition dynamically (see section \ref{ssec:gradual-soundness}).
    We have also discussed how those runtime checks can be reduced or even eliminated if \tset{\dgradT Soundness} holds (see lemma \ref{lemma:runtime-checks-reduced}).
    \item 
    This cause is more subtle and originates in restricting the domain of the small-step semantics to achieve completeness as described in section \ref{ssec:perfect-knowledge}.
    Restricting the domain usually means adding additional checks that determine whether the function is defined or not.
    Example \ref{ex:cex-gdpres} illustrates this effect using the example of an assertion statement.
    Note that a compiler may also simplify or omit these static checks using the knowledge provided by the deterministic lifting (given that  \tset{\dgradT Soundness} holds).
\end{enumerate}

%% svlidf
The small-step semantics of \svlidf we gave in chapter \ref{ch:case-study--implicit} were designed to be (partially) complete in the first place (see lemma \ref{lemma:pc-idf}).
Note however, that a lot of checks they perform could have been omitted for \svlidf (e.g. assertions could have been implemented as no-operations as motivated in example \ref{ex:cex-gdpres}), yet they are necessary for \tset{\dgradT Soundness} of \gvlidf.

%% static annotations
It is a desirable property of gradual systems to not impose any runtime overhead (compared to the static system) should all annotations be static.
We give sufficient criteria for a gradual verification system with this property.
\begin{lemma}[Overhead-Free Gradual Verification System]
    \label{lemma:oh-free}~\\
    For fully statically annotated programs, a gradual verification system is overhead-free if \tset{\dgradT Soundness} and
    \begin{align}
    \label{lemma-frm:oh-free}
    \forall \phi_1 \in \setFormula,\, s \in \setStmt,\, \grad{\phi_2} \in \setGFormula.~ \dgthoare{}{\phi_1}{s}{\grad{\phi_2}} \implies \grad{\phi_2} \in \setFormula
    \end{align}
    holds.
    Intuitively, this condition states that the deterministic gradual Hoare logic is precise for all static input.
    
   % Optimality of the deterministic lifting does not necessarily imply \ref{lemma-frm:oh-free} if \tset{\dgradT Soundness} holds.
   % A stricter version of this lemma would thus read:
   % For fully statically annorated programs, no runtime overhead is necessary if \tset{\dgradT Soundness} and the deterministic gradual Hoare logic is an optimal deterministic lifting.
\end{lemma}

Note: \gvlidf satisfies the criteria given by lemma \ref{lemma:oh-free} and can thus be implemented overhead-free for statically annotated programs.
The implementation we mention in section \ref{sec:implementation} is overhead-free for statically annotated programs.
