% It is one of our design goals to make any program of the static system a valid program of the 
% the resulting gradual system compatible with the old one (otherwise it would trivially not  satisfy the gradual guarantee \ref{grad-guarantee}).

The fundamental concept of gradual verification is the introduction of a wildcard formula $\qm$ into the formula syntax of the static verification system.
This wildcard is supposed to be usable as a placeholder for unknown knowledge and will be “instantiated” by the gradual verifier on demand.

Example...


The first difference of \gvl in comparison to \svl is thus an extension of the set of formulas $\setFormula$, resulting in a superset of gradual formulas $\setGFormula \supset \setFormula$ with $\qm \in \setGFormula$ but $\qm \not \in \setFormula$.
We decorate gradual formulas $\grad{\phi} \in \setGFormula$ to distinguish them from formulas drawn from $\setFormula$.

Using the concept of abstract interpretation, we want to give meaning to gradual formulas by mapping them back to a set of satisfiable static formulas (called “concretization”).
The concretization is supposed to represent a “plausible” set of static formulas
This way we can reason about a gradual formula by applying preexisting static reasoning to the formulas concretization.
For example, we want a program state $\pi$ to satisfy a gradual formula $\grad{\phi}$ iff $\pi$ satisfies (at least) one of the static formulas drawn from the concretization of $\grad{\phi}$.
(This intuition is formalized in section \ref{ssec:lifting-predicates}.)

\begin{definition}[Concretization]~\\
    Let $\gamma : \setGFormula \rightarrow \PP(\setFormulaA)$ be defined as
    \begin{align*}
    &\gamma(\phi) = 
        \begin{cases}
        \{~ \phi ~\}  & \phi \in \setFormulaA\\
        \emptyset     & \textit{otherwise}
        \end{cases}\\
    &\gamma(\qm) = \setFormulaA
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}



% more detail about singleton mapping and why it makes sense?


There are slightly different ways to introduce the wildcard, we will describe two common options in the following sections.
Yet there are some rules for this step that we can already motivate.
