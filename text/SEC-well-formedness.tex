Apart from checking method contracts, a verifier or compiler may enforce further rules before accepting a program as “well formed”.
For \svlidf we give the following rules.

%% OkMethod
The premises of $\tset{OkMethod}$ make sure that reasoning about calls is sound.
As expected, the method contract is checked, while also making sure that it contains self-framing formulas.
Furthermore, the free variables are restricted to those occurring in the method signature.

%% example
\begin{example}{Leaking Postcondition}
\begin{lstlisting}
int identity(int a)
    requires true;
    ensures  (b = 3);
{
    int b;
    b = 3;
    return a;
}
\end{lstlisting}
While the method passes static verification, it could lead to unsound proofs.
Note how \tset{HCall} forwards the postcondition after replacing known variables with their counterparts.
\phiEq{b}{3} is unaffected by this replacement, ending up in the postcondition of the call statement.
\end{example}
