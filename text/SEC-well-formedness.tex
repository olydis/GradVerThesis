Apart from checking method contracts, a verifier or compiler may enforce further rules before accepting a program as “well-formed”.
For \svlidf we give the rules formalized in figure \ref{fig:idf-wf}.

%% OkMethod
The premises of $\tset{OkMethod}$ make sure that reasoning about calls is sound.
As expected, the method contract is checked, while also making sure that it contains self-framing formulas.
Furthermore, the free variables are restricted to those occurring in the method signature.
The following example illustrates why this is necessary.

%% example
\begin{example}{Leaking Postcondition}
\begin{lstlisting}
int identity(int a)
    requires true;
    ensures  (b = 3);
{
    int b;
    b = 3;
    return a;
}
\end{lstlisting}
While the method itself passes static verification, it could lead to unsound proofs when called.
Note how \tset{HCall} forwards the postcondition after replacing known variables with their counterparts.
\phiEq{b}{3} is unaffected by this replacement, ending up in the postcondition of the call statement.

Should the call site also know a variable \ttt{b}, then \phiEq{b}{3} will most likely not reflect the true state of that variable.
\end{example}

For similar reasons, we prevent writes to the method's parameter and $\ethis$.
Changes to those variables would otherwise end up in the postcondition which is forwarded to the call site.
However, since writes to the parameter or $\ethis$ do not affect variables at the call site (due to call-by-value semantics), this information would be false.
