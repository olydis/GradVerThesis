Apart from checking method contracts, a verifier or compiler may enforce further rules before accepting a program as “well formed”.
For \svlidf we give the rules formalized in figure \ref{fig:idf-wf}.

%% OkMethod
The premises of $\tset{OkMethod}$ make sure that reasoning about calls is sound.
As expected, the method contract is checked, while also making sure that it contains self-framing formulas.
Furthermore, the free variables are restricted to those occurring in the method signature.
The following example illustrates why this is necessary.

%% example
\begin{example}{Leaking Postcondition}
\begin{lstlisting}
int identity(int a)
    requires true;
    ensures  (b = 3);
{
    int b;
    b = 3;
    return a;
}
\end{lstlisting}
While the method passes static verification, it could lead to unsound proofs.
Note how \tset{HCall} forwards the postcondition after replacing known variables with their counterparts.
\phiEq{b}{3} is unaffected by this replacement, ending up in the postcondition of the call statement.

Should the call site also know a variable \ttt{b}, then \phiEq{b}{3} will most likely not reflect the state of that variable.
\end{example}

For similar reasons, we prevent writes to the method's parameter.
Changes to the parameter would otherwise end up in the postcondition which is forwarded to the call site.
Information about the formal parameter is then reflected back on the variable passed as actual parameter for the method call.
However, since parameters are passed by value, this information would be false -- the actual parameter will have the same value before and after the method call.
