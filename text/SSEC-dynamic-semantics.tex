% MENTION that most of that stuff is completely redundant if soundness holds - and only used to prove just that!
The small-step semantics $\sssem : \setProgramState \rightharpoonup \setProgramState$ of \svlidf are defined inductively in figure \ref{fig:svl-sem-dyn-sstep}.
Note that right-associativity of \ttt{;} and termination of sequences with $\sSkip$ (see section \ref{sec:syntax}) obviates the need for dedicated sequence rules.

We use arrow notation as we believe it is more readable for inductive rules.
\begin{displaymath}
\sssem(\pi) = \pi' \defiff \sstep{\pi}{\pi'}
\end{displaymath}
Using inductive rules to define a partial function, we have to make sure that only one result is deducible for every input.
\begin{lemma}[$\sssem$ Well-Defined]
    The small-step semantics of \svlidf is well-defined.
\end{lemma}

% Again, the semantics is implicitly parameterized over some program $p$.
