% MENTION that most of that stuff is completely redundant if soundness holds - and only used to prove just that!
The small-step semantics $\sstep{\cdot}{\cdot} : \setProgramState \rightharpoonup \setProgramState$ of \svlidf are defined inductively in figure \ref{fig:svl-sem-dyn-sstep}.
Note that right-associativity of \ttt{;} and termination of sequences with $\sSkip$ (see section \ref{sec:syntax}) obviate the need for dedicated sequence rules.

Using inductive rules to define a partial function, we have to make sure that at most one result is deducible for every input.
\begin{lemma}[$\sstep{\cdot}{\cdot}$ Well-Defined]
    \label{lemma:ss-wd}~\\
    The small-step semantics of \svlidf is well-defined.

% Again, the semantics is implicitly parameterized over some program $p$.
