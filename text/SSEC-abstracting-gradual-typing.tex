As this work is based on the advances in gradual typing, it is helpful to understand the developments in that area.
Gradual typing for functional programming languages was formalized by \cite{siek2006gradual}.
They describe a $\lambda$-calculus with optional type annotations, which is sound w.r.t. simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus for fully annotated terms.
Static and dynamic type type checking is seamlessly combined by automatically inserting runtime checks where necessary.

This work has later been extended in a variety of ways.
Wolff et al. introduced “gradual typestate” \cite{wolff2011gradual}, circumventing the rigidity of static typestate checking.
Schwerter, Garcia and Tanter developed a theory of gradual effect systems \cite{banados2014theory}, making it possible to incrementally annotate and statically check effects by adding a notion of unknown effects.
An implementation for gradual effects in Scala was later given by \cite{toro2015customizable}.

\label{grad-guarantee}
Siek et al. recently formalized refined criteria for gradual typing, called “gradual guarantee” \cite{siek2015refined}.
The gradual guarantee states that well typed programs will stay well typed when removing type annotations (static part).
It furthermore states that well typed programs evaluating to a value will evaluate to the same value when removing type annotations (dynamic part).

With “Abstracting Gradual Typing” (AGT) \cite{garcia2016abstracting} Garcia, Clark and Tanter propose a new formal foundation for gradual typing.
Their approach draws on the principles from abstract interpretation, defining a gradual type system in terms of an existing static one.
The resulting system satisfies the gradual guarantee by construction.
Subsequent work by Garcia and Tanter demonstrates the flexibility of AGT by applying the concept to security-typed language, yielding a gradual security language \cite{garcia2015deriving}, which in contrast to prior work does not require explicit security casts.
