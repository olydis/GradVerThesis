As this work is based on the advances in gradual typing, it is helpful to understand the developments in that area.

Gradual type systems originated from efforts to overcome limitations and drawbacks of purely static or dynamic type systems.
Corresponding extensions to dynamic type systems 

Early 
Languages that support gradual typing
to a large degree include Cecil [8], Boo [10], extensions to Visual
Basic.NET and C\# proposed by Meijer and Drayton [26], and extensions
to Java proposed by Gray et al. [17], and the Bigloo [6, 36]
dialect of Scheme [24]. The purpose of this paper is to provide a
type-theoretic foundation for languages such as these with gradual
typing.
There are numerous other ways to combine stati

Gradual typing for functional programming languages was formalized by Siek and Taha \cite{siek2006gradual}.
They describe a $\lambda$-calculus with optional type annotations, which is sound w.r.t. simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus for fully annotated terms.
Static and dynamic type type checking is seamlessly combined by automatically inserting runtime checks (casts) where necessary.

This work has later been extended in a variety of ways.
Wolff et al. introduced “gradual typestate” \cite{wolff2011gradual}, circumventing the rigidity of static typestate checking.
Schwerter, Garcia and Tanter developed a theory of gradual effect systems \cite{banados2014theory}, making it possible to incrementally annotate and statically check effects by adding a notion of unknown effects.
An implementation for gradual effects in Scala was later given by Toro and Tanter \cite{toro2015customizable}.

\label{grad-guarantee}
Siek et al. recently formalized refined criteria for gradual typing, called “gradual guarantee” \cite{siek2015refined}.
The gradual guarantee states that well typed programs will stay well typed when removing type annotations (static part of the guarantee).
It furthermore states that well typed programs evaluating to a value will evaluate to the same value when removing type annotations (dynamic part of the guarantee).

With “Abstracting Gradual Typing” (AGT) \cite{garcia2016abstracting} Garcia, Clark and Tanter propose a new formal foundation for gradual typing.
Their approach draws on the principles of abstract interpretation, defining a gradual type system in terms of an existing static one.
The resulting system satisfies the gradual guarantee by construction.
Subsequent work by Garcia and Tanter demonstrates the flexibility of AGT by applying the concept a to security-typed language, yielding a gradual security language \cite{garcia2015deriving}, which in contrast to prior work does not require explicit security casts.
