As well-formedness was a condition of soundness of \svlidf, we give an adjusted version that is required for soundness of \gvlidf (see figure \ref{fig:gidf-wf}).
Note that the only changes are a more flexible contract for the main method, as well as the gradual method contract.
We define $\FV(\withqm{\phi}) \defeq \FV(\phi)$.
